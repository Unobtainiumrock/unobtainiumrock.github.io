# My Story: A Path Towards Data Science

#### Turning Point: A Navy Career Interrupted
Losing 17 pounds, bleeding internally, and becoming serverely anemmic and depressed. This was the turning point in my life, which marked the end of my young career of 5 years in the U.S. Navy and my long journey towards becoming a data scientist. I can clearly remember all of the events that led to my breaking point. I was stationed for a little over a year in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba  as the Leading Petty Officer of my department when we were notified that we would be  receiving a fresh batch of personnel. One of these personnel  was to take over my role as supervisor, thus making me their suboordinate in the process. This was something I had expected, since I was temporarily fulfilling a role above my paygrade until more senior personnel could be brought in. Litle did I know how much this single event would impact my life.

#### The Struggle: Overcoming Hazing and Health Crises
My experience was difficult because the person taking over my position wasn't very kind and was extremely overbearing in their management style, to the point of hazing. The negative aspects poured over into my personal life where I would be asked things like " where are you  spending all your time?" and "why it takes so long to do dishes or cook meals?". This wasn't the first time I've had to deal with people like this, but I had hoped that my time in my previous duty station would mark the end of that. Needless to say, it was a nightmare to be facing it yet again. This was the start of the rapid decline in my health triggered in part by extreme stress.

#### Diagnosis and Rock Bottom
Whenever somebody in the military falls ill, they can be assigned a status called SIQ, which means "Sick In Quarters". It's typically given to those that are ill enough that they're prevented from performing their duties. This status usually lasts anywhere between 24 - 72 hours. This was the status I was assigned after visiting the doctor where they observed that my pancreatic enzymes were dangerously high. I was diagnosed with acute idopathic pacreatitis, which simply means that my pancreas was inflamed with a sudden onset and unknown cause. During my time under SIQ, I did  my best to adhere to their fasting regiment, bed rest, and medications. Unfortunately my same supervisor would show up unannounced to my quarters or call me during his working hours, further exacerbating the state of my health and eventually convincing me to return to work sooner. It was during one of those premature return to work days that I remember feeling extreme abdominal discomfort and had blood in the bathroom. The enventually led to me being medically evactuated back to the states via small plane where I would later be diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

#### The Road to Remission: A New Perspective on Life
For those of you unfamiliar with the disease, it is an autoimmune disease in which my own immune system attacks my digestive system, resulting in a wide range of symptoms that can vary in their degree of severity. During the very early stages of navigating my diagnosis, I'd hit rock bottom. I felt like I didn't have the energy to do anything and that I'd become a burden to those around me. The one person who supported me through those very dark times was my partner. She stuck through all of the struggles and convinced me to go on the medications available, despite my concerns about the side effects. She opened my eyes to the possibility that my decisions about my health aren't only about me, but that they affect the lives of my family and loved ones. It was because of her valuable lesson that I was able to swallow my concerns, pride, and whatever else was holding me back and later achieve disease remission. 

#### Lessons Learned: Strength, Empathy, and Work-Life Balance
If life hadn't thrown me this disaster of a curveball, I might have still been in the Navy, closing in on retirement. I know that not everyone else diagnosed with an automimmune disease can be as lucky as me and come out the other side so clean, so I'm extremeley grateful for the experience. It's because of this that I now know what it was like to hit rock bottom. I've learned important lessons like standing up for myself, how my decisions can affect those around me, and most importantly, I've learned to never lose hope and fight things to the very end.

Experiences like this are what have helped shaped me into the team member that I am today. I've learned the importance in practicing empathy with those I manage, I've learned when to swallow my pride for the sake of team cohesion, and I've learned the importance of a work life balance. 

#### Today
Since my time in the Navy and my path to remission, I've experiened the joy of delving into the world of full stack web development, returning to school, and recently graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in Data Science. I have a deep love for mathematics, and solving complex problems. In my free time you can catch me automating away the mundane repetitive tasks of my life, tinkering  with AI tech & training models, playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, or gardending.

The primary value I bring to a team are in three key areas:

1. I'm a systems thinker. Tech debt is my mortal enemy, so I tend to focus on how to build applications in a manner that are manageable, scalable over time, and comprehensible.
2. I excel at pattern spotting and I leverage this to become an automation king. The automations I create save significant time in man hours on repetitive tasks. This is an area I've had great success in helping clients.
3. Bugs dream of getting past me. Although I'm able to see the forest for the trees in a systems thinking approach, I'm also extremely detail oriented. I am usually the last line of defense in catching bugs before they reach production in a team setting.
